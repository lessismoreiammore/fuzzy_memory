My project's main purpose was to create a simple memory game in pure HTML, CSS, JS.

##1. Example##

This screenshot show the basic flow of the game

*Beginning of the game*
![screenshot_1](readme_files/screenshot_1.png)

*End of the game*
![screenshot_2](readme_files/screenshot_2.png)

The game is repeated after the user presses the **"Play againâ†»"** button.

##2. Installation##

No installation is required since the project is a simple web application with a JS script inside.

To run the project, simply run the [index.html](index.html).

The project was tested in major modern browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, etc.) and behaves correctly.

The code was checked by the [W3C Markup Validation Service](W3C Markup Validation Service) and [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

All the selectors were checked whether they require any web browser prefix.
