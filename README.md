My project's main purpose was to create a simple memory game in pure HTML, CSS, JS.

1. **Example**

This screenshot show the basic flow of the game

*Beginning of the game*
![screenshot_1](readme_files/screenshot_1.png)

*End of the game*
![screenshot_2](readme_files/screenshot_2.png)

The game is repeated after the user presses the **"Play againâ†»"** button.
